        <br>
       
        <p>
          Hello! “Now this is a story all about how my life got flipped turned upside down and I’d like to take a minute, 
          just sit right there I’ll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel-Air…” wait, no, sorry wrong story. 
          That is Will Smith’s story, but I bet I just had you singing along in your best Will Smith voice!
        </p> 
        <p>
          My story is a little different. It does not include a mansion in Bel-Air, but I think it is just as exciting so let me take a 
          minute, just sit right there and I’ll tell you how I became the Fresh Kat of the ATL.
          Florida, born and raised, is where I have spent all of my days.  I was born in Tampa, Florida and moved up to 
          Tallahassee, Florida when I was just 5 years old.  I have been “Chillin’ out, maxin’, relaxin’ all cool” in 
          Tallahassee ever since. I even went to college in Tallahassee, graduating from the great Florida State University.  
          I have two degrees. I majored in both Italian with a minor in Education and Information Technology. After living in 
          Tallahassee for most of my life I decided it was time for a new  adventure in 2018. I packed up my things and my dog 
          and cruised on up to Atlanta, Georgia for new experiences and opportunities, as well as, to be closer to my family.
          I pulled into Atlanta a little after four wondering is this the type of place for this cool Kat? Atlanta traffic…what was 
          I thinking? Then I thought if I’ve conquered Atlanta traffic, then I can conquer anything you throw at me. I am ready 
          to bring my A-game.  I sure hope Atlanta is prepared for this fresh Kat.
        </p>

        <p>Spoiler Alert: I do not think it was. It has been a crazy ride thus far these past few years, but I know am just getting started.</p>
        </p>
        <br>
        <h5>How did you get into Data Analytics?</h5>
        <p>
          I've always had a love for technology and pretty quick to pick it up. I graduated in 2012
          with a second degree in Information Technology. I dabbled in SQL and web design after I completed my degree, but it was in 2015
          when I became the Database Coordinator for a local Florida Chamber of Commerce that I discovered my passion for data. 
          Looking back, it is funny to me because that Database Coordinator position was not even the job for which I applied. I applied
          for a Marketing position, but because of my Information Technology degree and some other work experience they wanted me to come on 
          board as the Database Coordinator. Boy! I am so thankful I accepted that role because it led me to discover my true love of SQL 
          and creating reports. I found I loved being able to tell a story with data. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Fast forward a few years later... I decided to take my basic skills even further and enroll in a Data Analytics bootcamp
          with Georgia Tech. Accepting that Database Coordinator position may have been my first best decision, but enrolling in the bootcamp 
          is right up there! I graduated November 2020 and now have the skills and the know-how to be successful and take my passion for 
          data even further.  
        </p>
        <p>
          Some say if you love what you do then you will never work a day in your life. Well, if that is true, then I know 
          I have made the right career choice! 
        </p>
        <br>
        <h5>What do you do outside of work?</h5>
          <p>
            I love naps, Netflix, and long walks to the fridge! Just kidding...well, sort of! Can you tell I do not take 
            myself too seriously? I do love naps, Netflix, and long walks to the fridge, but I am also so much more. I also love 
            long walks through every aisle at Target and Home Depot. 
          </p>
          <p>
            On a deeper level, I am a nerd through and through and read history and biography books for fun. I never want
            to stop learning. I enjoy getting caught up in a really good movie or tv show. I am an artsy being to my core and 
            love creating in all areas of my life. Have I mentioned that my latest hobby is woodworking? You read that right...woodworking. 
            Feel free to check out my work at <a href="http://girlwiththeredballoon.com/" target="_blank">The Girl with the Red Balloon</a>, which is my blog for 
            all things DIY, travel, and junkercising. 
          </p>
          <p>Overall, I am a pretty cool Kat once you get to know me and I think I would make a great addition to your team!</p>
